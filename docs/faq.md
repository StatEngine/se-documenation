**What version should I use?**

StatEngine is available either as a hosted cloud version or an on-premise installation. Using the cloud version, all of the data is stored on our secure cloud servers and you can access the platform anywhere using any Browser or mobile devices. The cloud version offers additional features such as the App marketplace. Little to no maintenance is needed once we're setup and running. The on-premise version is also available, if you prefer managing all aspects of the platform yourself. We recommend using the on-premise version as a way to experiment with the platform or if your prefer to keep all data local to your department. We also only recommend using the on-premise method if you have skilled IT personnel available to setup and support the platform.
