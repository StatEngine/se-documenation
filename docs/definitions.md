# Definitions

Some departments may calculate `response time`, `event time` or other metrics differently from their neighboring counties or states.
To avoid confusion and to assure complete transparency, this section serves as a dictionary of common terms and calculation defintions in StatEngine.
StatEngine, in general, follows terminology and calculations set forth in NFAP [1710](https://www.nfpa.org/Codes-and-Standards/ARCHIVED/Safer-Act-Grant/NFPA-1710)/[1720](https://www.nfpa.org/Codes-and-Standards/ARCHIVED/Safer-Act-Grant/NFPA-1720) guidelines.
