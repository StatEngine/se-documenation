## What is StatEngine?

StatEngine is a real-time open source data analytics and visualization platform built from the ground up for public safety organizations. StatEngine is built on powerful, best-of-breed, open source analytics and visualization tools.

StatEngine is currently funded by the [Public Safety Innovation Accelerator Program (PSIAP)](https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/real-time-open-source-data-analytics-and-visualization-platform).
